# 🤖 Robot Operating System (ROS 2) Projects

This repo has all my ROS 2 projects and practice files.

I made this while learning ROS 2 to understand how things work like:
- Nodes
- Topics
- Services
- Parameters
- Launch files
- TF (transformations)
- URDF (robot model)
- RViz (visualization)
- Gazebo (robot simulation)
- Custom messages and services
